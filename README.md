# JC_Online_Clothing
487 Online Clothing Store App

The project was developed using intellij IDE, apache tomcat 9.0.54 server and mysql databse. The code is written in HTML, CSS, Java and JSP.

The database is named JCClothing and is accessed using user = user and password = password. You can run the db_script.txt file
to create the tables and prepopulate them with info to get started. The first section of the script is commented out, but may need to be run the first time to create the user and grant it privileges. Please be advised, without running the script, there will be no items in the catalog to view. 

A few updates have been made since the demo. You can now edit items in the catalog (must be an admin). The user list includes contact info for the users. You can now add and remove staff members (must be an admin). Note staff members are not removed but "demoted" to standard users. 

If you add or edit items in the catalog, you will need the image filename, and the image needs to be in the resources_web folder. The watches are not part of the db_script.txt file, so they are good candidates to test with as their jpgs are in the folder. 

Logins to use if the db_script.txt file is loaded to the database.
admin/password
staff/password
johndoe/password
