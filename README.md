# JC_Online_Clothing
487 Online Clothing Store App

The project was developed using intellij IDE, apache tomcat 9.0.54 server and mysql databse. The code is written in HTML, CSS, Java and Java JSP.

The database is named JCClothing and is accessed using user = user and password = password. You can run the db_script.txt file
to prepopulate the database with users and items. The first section of the script is commented out, but need to be run the first time to create the user and grant it privileges. Please be advised, without running the script, there will be no items in the catalog to view. 

If you add or edit items in the catalog, you will need the image filename, and the image needs to be in the web-resources folder. The watches are not part of the db_script.txt file, so they are good candidates to test with. 

Logins to use if the db_script.txt file is loaded to the database.
admin/password
staff/password
johndoe/password
